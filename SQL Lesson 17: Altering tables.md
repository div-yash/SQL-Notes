- As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

#### Adding columns: 
- The syntax for adding a new column is similar to the syntax when creating new rows in the CREATE TABLE statement.
- You need to specify the data type of the column along with any potential table constraints and default values to be applied to both existing and new rows.
- In some databases like MySQL, you can even specify where to insert the new column using the FIRST or AFTER clauses, though this is not a standard feature.

#### Altering table to add new column(s):
> ALTER TABLE mytable                           
 ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint            
    DEFAULT default_value;             

#### Removing columns:
- Dropping columns is as easy as specifying the column to drop, however, some databases (including SQLite) don't support this feature.
- Instead you may have to create a new table and migrate the data over.

 Altering table to remove column(s):
> ALTER TABLE mytable            
DROP column_to_be_deleted;


#### Renaming the table:                      
- If you need to rename the table itself, you can also do that using the RENAME TO clause of the statement.

Altering table name:
> ALTER TABLE mytable         
RENAME TO new_table_name;

#### Exercise: 
Our exercises use an implementation that only support adding new columns, so give that a try below.

Table: movies                          
id	title	director	year	length_minutes                        
1	Toy Story	John Lasseter	1995	81                    
2	A Bug's Life	John Lasseter	1998	95                   
3	Toy Story 2	John Lasseter	1999	93               
4	Monsters, Inc.	Pete Docter	2001	92                   
5	Finding Nemo	Andrew Stanton	2003	107                    
6	The Incredibles	Brad Bird	2004	116                   
7	Cars	John Lasseter	2006	117              
8	Ratatouille	Brad Bird	2007	115                      
9	WALL-E	Andrew Stanton	2008	104              
10	Up	Pete Docter	2009	101             
11	Toy Story 3	Lee Unkrich	2010	103                
12	Cars 2	John Lasseter	2011	120                    
13	Brave	Brenda Chapman	2012	102          
14	Monsters University	Dan Scanlon	2013	110                          

#### Tasks:
Add a column named Aspect_ratio with a FLOAT data type to store the aspect-ratio each movie was released in.:
> alter table movies         
add Aspect_ratio float;


Add another column named Language with a TEXT data type to store the language that the movie was released in. Ensure that the default for this language is English.:
> alter table movies         
add Language text                    
default English;
