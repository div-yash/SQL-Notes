### Database normalization
> Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and
> allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car).
> As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, and
> performance issues can arise when working with many large tables.

In order to answer questions about an entity that has data spanning multiple tables in a normalized database, we need to learn how to write a query that can combine all that data and pull out exactly the information we need.

### Multi-table queries with JOINs
> Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database.
> One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.

Using the JOIN clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the "INNER JOIN".

### Select query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables:

> SELECT column, another_table_column, â€¦
> FROM mytable
> INNER JOIN another_table
> ON mytable.id = another_table.id
> WHERE condition(s)
> ORDER BY column, â€¦ ASC/DESC
> LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;


The INNER JOIN is a process that matches rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by the ON constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables. After the tables are joined, the other clauses we learned previously are then applied.


> You might see queries where the INNER JOIN is written simply as a JOIN. These two are equivalent, but we will continue to refer to these joins as inner-joins because they make the query easier to read once you start using other types of joins, which will be introduced in the following lesson.


### Exercise
> We've added a new table to the Pixar database so that you can try practicing some joins. The BoxOffice table stores information about the ratings and sales of each particular Pixar movie, and the Movie_id column in that table corresponds with the Id column in the Movies table 1-to-1. Try and solve the tasks below using the INNER JOIN introduced above.

### Tasks

Find the domestic and international sales for each movie:
> SELECT title,domestic_sales,international_sales          
> FROM movies       
> join boxoffice        
> on movies.id=boxoffice.movie_id;               


Show the sales numbers for each movie that did better internationally rather than domestically:
> SELECT title,domestic_sales,international_sales FROM movies           
> join boxoffice        
> on movies.id=boxoffice.movie_id            
> where international_sales>domestic_sales;       


List all the movies by their ratings in descending order:
> SELECT title FROM movies           
> join boxoffice          
> on movies.id=boxoffice.movie_id             
> order by rating desc;
