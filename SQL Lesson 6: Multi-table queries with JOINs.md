### Database normalization
> Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and
> allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car).
> As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, and
> performance issues can arise when working with many large tables.

In order to answer questions about an entity that has data spanning multiple tables in a normalized database, we need to learn how to write a query that can combine all that data and pull out exactly the information we need.

### Multi-table queries with JOINs
> Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database.
> One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.

Using the JOIN clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the "INNER JOIN".

### Select query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables:

> SELECT column, another_table_column, …
> FROM mytable
> INNER JOIN another_table
> ON mytable.id = another_table.id
> WHERE condition(s)
> ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
> LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
