- In addition to adding new data, a common task is to update existing data,
- which can be done using an UPDATE statement.
- Similar to the INSERT statement, you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update.
- In addition, the data you are updating has to match the data type of the columns in the table schema.

#### Update statement with values:
> UPDATE mytable              
SET column = value_or_expr,                    
    other_column = another_value_or_expr,             
    â€¦                 
WHERE condition;

- The statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs,
- and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause.


#### Exercise: 
- It looks like some of the information in our Movies database might be incorrect, so go ahead and fix them through the exercises below.

#### Tasks: 
The director for A Bug's Life is incorrect, it was actually directed by John Lasseter:
>update movies           
set director="John Lasseter"        
where title="A Bug's Life";           

The year that Toy Story 2 was released is incorrect, it was actually released in 1999:
>update movies       
set year=1999      
where title="Toy Story 2";           

Both the title and director for Toy Story 8 is incorrect! The title should be "Toy Story 3" and it was directed by Lee Unkrich:
>update movies          
set title="Toy Story 3",         
director="Lee Unkrich"       
where title="Toy Story 8";
